M3 or **ManeFrame III** is a *supercomputing cluster*: a set of powerful computers that are connected to each other. It is built and maintained by Southern Methodist University.

M3 was built in 2024 to replace the retired cluster ManeFrame II (M2) and has been having several updates.

The M3 is maintained by 2 teams: a team of *system administrators*, who work directly at the cluster, and monitors its hardware and operating system, and a team of *HPC Applications*, who work with the SMU M3 users. The two teams work very closely together. As HPC Application services, we provide training workshops, online help and support.

We maintain a [very extensive website](https://s2.smu.edu/hpc/documentation/) which hosts plenty of information for M3 users. We have more than thousand of people using M3 everyday; they come from a variety of departments: Computer Science, Mathematic, Physics, Chemistry, Engineering, etc. M3 accounts are free for all SMU faculty, staff, and students.
